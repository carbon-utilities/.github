### Silicon
ASilicon is a feature-rich API that is currently under development. It aims to provide multiple endpoints to fulfill a wide range of developer needs. We are actively working on enhancing its capabilities to cater to diverse requirements.
### Graphite
Graphite is an extended version of the localStorage API. It offers support for objects, arrays, and key-value storage, making it a versatile choice for data management. By expanding upon the functionality of localStorage, Graphite provides developers with greater flexibility and convenience.
